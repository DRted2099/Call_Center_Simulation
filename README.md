# Call Center Simulation in MATLAB

The script simulates a call center using a dataset obtained from kaggle

The scripts with the different names are functions used in the main script 'project'. All the values and probabilities used in the main script are obtained from the excel file which consists of a dashboard

ASSUMPTIONS:
1. All binary values generated using probabilities are binary random variables.
2. Call durations for the employees are always between the maximum and minimum values which is obvtained from the dataset

The pdf file consists of the graphs obtained from the simulation.
